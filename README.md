This is the ReadMe file for the first problem sheet. 
It took me a while to get my repository working on my laptop so I didn't have enough time to finish the problem, so question 6 and 8 have not bee uploaded on time but I will still upload them whe I get them finished.
In this ReadMe I will explain what I done for each problem and resources I used to help.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1: Kon’nichiwa, Sekai!

For this program I used the example from "https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1" to write the code, then used Google Translate to put in "Hello, World!" in Japanese.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2: Current Time

For this program I had to print out the current date and time. I used "https://tour.golang.org/welcome/4" from the problem page to see how to use the import, and with some research I used the 't.Hour' for example to call a certain part of the time, so I could print out what parts I needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3: FizzBuzz

For FizzBuzz, you have to print out the word 'FizzBuzz' for a word that is divisble by 3 and 5, print 'Fizz' for a number that is divisble by 3 and 'Buzz' for a number that is divisble by 5. 
I used "http://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest" from the problem sheet to see the algorithm for it, then used a for loop with my own variables to create it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 4: Factorial Digit Sum

For this, I had to write a function that calculates the sum of the digits of the factorial of a number.
I used the function from "https://play.golang.org/p/5lZMq3bd8a" to help write the code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 5: Guessing Game

For this problem you had to guess a randomly generated number and count how many times it took to guess this number.
I adapted the code from "http://golangcookbook.blogspot.ie/2012/11/guess-number-game-in-golang.html"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 7: Palindome Test

For this, you had to write a function that tests whether a string is a palindrome.
I used "https://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Palindrome_detection#Go" to help.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 9: Newton's Method for Square Roots

Write a function to calculate the square root of a number using Newton’s method. We started this in a lab, so I did not need to do any online research.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 10: Reverse String

For this program you had to write a function to reverse a string.
I looked at a thread from this link "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1752414/how-to-reverse-a-string-in-go" to guide me with this program, except I used my own input.
